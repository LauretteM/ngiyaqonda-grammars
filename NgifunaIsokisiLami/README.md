# Story-based semantic grammar

The **Ngifuna Isokisis Lami** served as the stanrting point in developing appropriately levelled grammars for the foundation phase. An isiZulu  graded reader was selected from the VulaBula project and its sentences analysed for syntactic constructions. Then, a computational grammar, based on the story's vocabulary and plot, was developed that included those constructions. The vocabulary was expanded to include similar words in addition to those original to the story, such as a larger selection of colours.

The grammar was developed to generate semantically equivalent sentences in four languages, namely isiZulu, English, Afrikaans and Sepedi (in order of development).
