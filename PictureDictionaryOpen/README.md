# Picture Dictionary-based syntactic grammar

During the pilots at isiZulu and Sepedi schools, teacher expressed the need of learners for more freedom in constructing sentences. To serve this end, the **Picture Dictionary Open** grammar was developed. The grammar is based purely on syntactic categories, allowing potentially nonsensical combinations, or so-called "silly sentences". Furthermore, due to the semantic unpredictability of the sentences, while the grammar is parallel in a syntactic sentence, as far as popssible between the different languages, the sentences generated in the four languages are guaranteed to be translation equivalents of each other. This is exacerbated by uneven ambiguities within the grammars, such as that where isiZulu and Sepedi employ locativised nouns, English and Afrikaans use a variety of prepositions. For example, "esikolweni" and The lexicon is significantly larger than the semantic grammars, with more than 700 nouns and verbs included, based on the Picture Dictionary series.
