### Picture Dictionary-based semantic grammar

The **My School Bag** grammar is an example of a grammar that generates semantically equivalent translations in all four languages, but it's vocabulary and syntatic constructions are based on the words and phrases found in the Picture Dictionary for Foundation Phase series developed by the National Lexicography Units of South Africa.

In the My School Bag grammar, the categories of the grammar are semantic in nature, similar to the Ngifuna Isokisis Lami grammar.
